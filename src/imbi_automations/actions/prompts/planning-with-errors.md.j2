A validation agent audited the task agent's previous work and identified issues that need to be addressed in the next cycle.

## Validation Errors from Previous Cycle

{{ last_error }}

## Your Task as Planning Agent

Analyze these validation errors and create a NEW PLAN for the task agent to follow. Do NOT fix the errors yourself.

Your plan should:
1. Address the specific validation errors identified above
2. Include specific, actionable steps for the task agent to execute
3. Provide context about what went wrong and why
4. Structure the tasks in a logical order

Remember: You are creating a plan, not executing fixes. The task agent will receive your plan and make the actual changes.
